# rusty-planets

My first dive into what I hear is a wonderful language called Rust! I'm using the
[nannou](https://nannou.cc/) to create a simple planetoid simulator.

## Features

- Physically accurate forces
- Ability to create planetoids (TODO)
- Customizable/Personalizable Planets (TODO)
- Custom universe parameters (TODO)

## Notes about using Rust for the first time

- Rust is my first Systems/Low Level Programming Language and I planned to
  learn Rust as opposed to C or C++ to help break into new shoes so to speak

  - I plan to learn C or C++ once I can get the hang of Rust. My hope is that
    the practices that I have to adhere to with Rust will help me have a better
    mindset when programming with C/C++ (which I have heard is unsafe)

- The whole ownership system in Rust is really foreign to me. I understand the
  concepts behind them, but I sometimes get mixed up when applying them or how
  it actually works.

  - References/Dereferences and Pointer-esque stuff is really interesting
  stuff to work with

- Rust is a pretty nice language, though there's a lot for me too learn. The
  most confusing thing is probably how to return complex types. When trying
  to return a mapped range, I got things that totally flew over my head

- I'm so confused by lifetimes lol
